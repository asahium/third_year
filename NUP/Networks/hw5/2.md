## Task

1. Listen for ARP messages on the interface you got in part The Last Homework #1
2. Find ARP request that shows you the ip addresses used in the network. Network prefix is /24
3. Configure yourself some ip-address in a range .100-.200. Check that no one else has the same address.
4. Scan tcp ports above 60000 of the server that was requested in ARP request in #2
5. Using CURL, request the flag from that ip:port combination. Hostname is dont.use.nmap.bro.
6. Enter the flag

## Solution

* listen for ARP messages on the interface and find 172.255.255.1

    ```sudo ip addr add 172.255.255.101/24 dev tapX```

* configure yourself some ip-address in a range .100-.200. Check that no one else has the same address.

    ```sudo ip addr add 172.255.255.101/24 dev tapX```

* scan tcp ports above 60000 of the server, we need for 172.255.255.1

    ```nmap -p 60001-65535 172.255.255.1/24 -Pn```

    so we get 
    ```
    Nmap scan report for 172.255.255.1
    Host is up (0.13s latency).
    Not shown: 5534 filtered tcp ports (no-response)
    PORT      STATE SERVICE
    63210/tcp open  unknown
    ```

* finally we can request the flag

    ```curl -H "Host: dont.use.nmap.bro" 172.255.255.1:63210```


flag is NUP23{S3c0nd_fl4g_f0und!}
