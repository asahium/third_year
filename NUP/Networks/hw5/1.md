2. Install OpenVPN client version 2.
3. Download the configuration file attached
4. Send exactly 3 icmp timestamp-requests to 51.89.166.139 within 5 seconds
5. You have 30 secounds to connect to OpenVPN using the configuration file ( username and password - use anything you like )
6. Set the interface UP ( ip link in Linux, ifconfig in OSX )
7. Run wireshark / tcpdump and listen for Ethernet II packets with Type 0x9001
8. Collect your first flag

## Solution

* ```sudo hping3 51.89.166.139 --icmp --icmp-ts -c 3 -i u1000``` for sending 3 icmp timestamp-requests

* ```sudo openvpn config.ovpn``` for connecting to OpenVPN

* ```sudo ip link set tapX up``` for setting the interface UP (X is the number of the interface)

* ```sudo tcpdump -i tap0 -n``` for listening for Ethernet II packets with Type 0x9001

flag is NUP23{L3st_h0m3w0rk_n0t_g0nn4_b3_3asy}
