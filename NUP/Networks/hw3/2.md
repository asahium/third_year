## Task

1. The custom TLS library here is broken
2. The programmer mistyped TLS13_AES_128_GCM_SHA256 constant in the protocol.
3. It shall be 0x1301 but it was set to another value by mistake. The value is between 0x1302-0x1313.
4. Edit the raw python SSL client
5. Connect to the site and obtain the flag.

## Solution

* edit HOST to 8255344e21fcaf7b.annmuor.im and PORT to 8443

* edit request to ```b'GET / HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: 8255344e21fcaf7b.annmuor.im\r\n\r\n'```

* search for correct TLS version (spoiler 0x1309)

flag is NUP23{I_4m_th3_g0d_0f_TLS}
