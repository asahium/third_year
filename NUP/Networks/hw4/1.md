## Task

1. The server will only accept the connection if TTL is equals 3. 8255344e21fcaf7b.annmuor.im 64322/tcp

2. Collect the flag

## Solution

* we need to ping site to know TTL

* ```ping 8255344e21fcaf7b.annmuor.im```

* we get ttl=46 in both sides, so TTL is 23

* we need to set TTL to 25 (23+3-1 wtf?)

*  ```nc -M 25 8255344e21fcaf7b.annmuor.im 64322```

* mac os doesn't support -M flag, so we need change in sysctl ```sudo sysctl -w net.inet.ip.ttl=25```
