## Task

1. Connect to 8255344e21fcaf7b.annmuor.im port 65321 by IPv6
2. Collect the flag
* you may need to setup [6to4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/6to4) tunnel for that

## Solution

* download and install [miredo](https://www.remlab.net/miredo/) (or any other 6to4 client)

* for miredo after installation we need update config (in my case ```sudo nano /usr/local/etc/miredo/miredo.conf``` and uncomment ```ServerAddress   teredo.iks-jena.de```)

* start miredo (for me ```sudo /usr/local/sbin/miredo```) and check ```ifconfig teredo```

* connect to server ```telnet -6 8255344e21fcaf7b.annmuor.im 65321``` and get flag
